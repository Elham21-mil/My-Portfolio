        <h5 class="bi">Bio</h5>
        
<p class="history">As a third-year Information Systems student at Bahir Dar University, I'm on track to graduate next year with a<br>
strong foundation in IS principles. My joureny in to the world of technology began in Dessie and kemissie towns, <br>
where my curiosity was spareked early on . A particularly impactful experience was a visit to an Addis Ababa<br>
technology exhibition as a grade 8 student, where I had the opportunity to see the robot Sophia. This sparked<br>
a passion that was further nurtured by my father's insightful conversations about AI and rapidly evolving technology<br>
landscape. These early experiences fueled my desire to explore the potential of technology.</p>
<p class="elu">Throughout my academic carrer, I have consistently excelled in IS classes and have maintained a comulative CGPA <br>
of 3.19. I am particularly interested in [System designing and Website development]. In grade 12, I built my first portfolio<br>like
website using HTML, a project that not only earned me top grade but also solidified my passion for web development<br>
and user experience.</p>
<div class="pro">
<ul>To learn more about my skills and experience, please explore my projects:
<li><a href="asdas.fd">HighSchool Project</a></li>
<li><a href="dsfsdf.dsfsd">To do list project</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="ee">I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovate projects
and make a positive<br> impact in the field of Information Systems.
<br>Therfore, as a highly motivated Information Systems student, I'm eager to leverage my skills in front-end web developent<br>
to create engaging and user user-friendly web experiences.</p>
